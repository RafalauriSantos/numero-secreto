# Secret Number Picker

This project is a simple **Secret Number Picker** game, one of my first projects developed as part of my programming learning journey. It was created during my course at **Next One Education** in partnership with **Alura**.

## Description

The Secret Number Picker is a guessing game where the goal is to figure out a random number generated by the system. The player inputs guesses, and the game provides feedback on whether the secret number is higher or lower. The game continues until the player guesses correctly.

## Features

- Generates a random secret number within a defined range.
- Accepts player guesses.
- Provides "higher" or "lower" hints based on the player's guess.
- Displays a victory message when the player guesses the correct number.
